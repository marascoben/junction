#  Junction

> This project was developed for the course CSCI6221 "Advanced Software Paradigms" at the George Washington University.

A simple TCP load balancer written in Rust. The primary goal of this project was to learn and describe the Rust language, while the final version *works* it is a very rough implementation.

## Usage

```bash
cargo run --package junction --bin junction
```

## Presentation

The final presentation I gave on the Rust language can be [found here](./rustlang.pdf).
